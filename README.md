## üöÄ Live Demo
üåê The application is deployed and live on Render   
üëâ [Access the web app here](https://data-science-salary-project.onrender.com/)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The initial load of the web app may take 30-60 seconds as the service spins up.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> For the best experience, please refer to the [Usage Guide](#-usage-guide) section below to learn how to navigate and use the web app effectively.
  
<br>

## üìå Project Overview
   - Developed a robust model to predict the salary of Data Scientists in India.
   - Collected data from glassdoor website, scraped over 800 job postings.
   - Cleaned and pre-processed the raw data.
   - Engineered new featues, created new features that captures the importance of tools like 'python', 'r', 'sql', 'aws', 'spark', 'genai', 'LLMs' for a data science role.
   - Trained multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluated them using cross-validation and GridSearch.
   - **Integrated MLflow to track experiments, metrics, hyperparameters, and model artifacts automatically.**
   - Deployed the best-performing model as a Flask API.
   - Successfully hosted the web app on **Render** for continuous availability



# üß± Project Workflow 
## 1. Data Collection:
   - Using selenium framework I scraped the Data Science job postings within India from the glassdoor website. 
   - Scraped all the job postings from the website (around 900 job postings).
   - For each job I collected the following:
       * Company Name
       * Job Title
       * Salary Estimate 
       * Location of the job
       * Job Description
       * Rating of the company

## 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: 
   - Once the data is scraped I performed data clearning process and also prepared the data for model building.
   - During the clearning process I did the following:
        * Filled the missing values using the most suitable method (there were a lot of missing values so couldn't just drop it)
        * Removed unwanted text, black spaces from the values of different columns
        * Parsed numeric data from 'Salary Esitmate' column.
        * Found the age of the company using 'Founded' column.
        * Created the following new columns for the skills, tools listed in 'Job Description' column:
             * Python
             * r
             * sql
             * aws
             * spark
             * genai
             * LLMs
       * Created new features for type of roles, seniority levels. 

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering:
   - After the data is clearned I analyzed the data to find hidden patterns, trends other relationship between features.
   - Performed both univariate and bivariate/multi-variate analysis.
   - Visualized the distribution of each features and explored the values and their counts of each features.
   - Visualized the presence of missing values in the dataset.
   - Found relationship (correlation) between features.
   - Found relationship between the revenue of the company and the salary they provide.
   - Found the companies which has higher ratings (more than 4.0 & 4.5)
   - Found the common industries and sectors the company is in and so on.

## 4. Model Building with MLFlow tracking:
  - Split the dataset into train and test sets.
  - Trained multiple models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost).
  - **Logged model parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow**.
  - **Used MLflow to register and compare the best-performing model based on R¬≤ score.**

## 5. Productionization & Deployment:
   - Built a Flask API endpoint that takes in job posting details and returns estimated salary.
   - Designed an intuitive web interface using HTML and CSS for user interaction..
   - Deployed the application on Render with continuous availability.
   - The live application is accessible to anyone with internet access.
