Combining computer science, modeling, statistics, analytics, and math skills—along with sound business sense—data scientists uncover the answers to major questions that help organizations make objective decisions. The ability to transform a sea of data into actionable insights can have a profound impact—for predicting the best new diabetes treatment to identifying and thwarting national security threats. That’s why businesses and government agencies are rushing to hire data science professionals who can help do just that. The first step toward establishing an active data analytics platform is to collect structured and unstructured data from different sources. Unstructured data consists of things like what customers are saying about the organization on social media, while structured data is a measurable metric, such as customer lifetime value.

A data scientist cleans and validates the data to ensure its accuracy and completeness. While AI-powered data analytics tools can automate part of this process, cleaning data still makes up the bulk of a data scientist’s job duties. Once the data is clean, the data scientist analyzes the data to identify patterns and trends using advanced statistics skills.

Vendasta Technology (India) Private Limited,4.0,Machine Learning Engineer,Chennai,"Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without explicit programming. It focuses on developing algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. Essentially, machine learning allows computers to learn from experience, just like humans do, by adjusting their behavior based on the data they are exposed to. Here's a more detailed explanation: Core Concepts:
Learning from Data:Machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships within the data.
No Explicit Programming:Unlike traditional programming, where you tell the computer exactly what to do, ML algorithms learn from data and adapt their behavior.
Prediction and Decision Making:The goal of ML is to enable systems to make accurate predictions or decisions based on the patterns they have learned.",₹5L – ₹8L/yr (Glassdoor Est.),₹6L/yr Median
